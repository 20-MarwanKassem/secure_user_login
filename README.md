# secure_user_login
This Python program implements a user registration and login system with password hashing using the SHA-256 algorithm. Users can register with a unique username and password, and log in to their account with the same credentials. The program stores user information in a dictionary and includes input validation. The main menu offers options to register, login, or exit. The register function stores the hashed password and username in the database, while the login function compares the hashed password entered by the user with the one in the database. The program displays appropriate messages to the user based on the outcome. This program provides a basic framework for a user registration and login system.
